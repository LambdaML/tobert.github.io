This is a new thing I'm trying. I'm calling these posts "TL;DR" to remind
myself to keep it short.

I was previously setting up posts similar to Jekyll with YAML front matter
and all kinds of junk. Normally I don't even get these published before I
get distracted so it was time to remove some noise. A 'tldr' post in my
blog generator is just a markdown file with some markdown in it that uses
the filename and its mtime for metadata and that's it.

Check out my first TL;DR: [Xperia Z3 MTP Linux](/tldr/xperia-z3-mtp-linux.html)
