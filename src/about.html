<p>I am a father, technologist, musician, and open source mechanic working for <a href="http://datastax.com">Datastax</a>.
<br/><br/>
While attending <a href="http://cmich.edu">university</a> as a music major, I got into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a>s. I played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realms_of_despair">Realms of Despair</a> for about a year before I realized I really wanted to hack on them. I had done a little BASIC on Apple IIe in middle school, so I figured "how hard could it be?"
<br/><br/>
Since all I had at the time was a 486 running Windows 95, my first experience with C was via Cygwin. Someone recommended
that I pick up a copy of Slackware Unleashed from the student bookstore and give it try. I did. A couple months later
I emerged from my apartment with early signs of neckbeard and headed off to Detroit to start my career as a
Junior Systems Administrator. Many things have changed since then.
<br/><br/>
Over the 15 or so years of my career, I have worked on everything from hacking Linux kernel drivers to
<a href="https://github.com/tobert/f7u12">HTML5 games</a>, mostly from some kind of devops role.
<br/><br/>
As an evangelist for <a href="http://planetcassandra.com">Cassandra</a> and <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Spark</a>,
I do a fair amount of public speaking, as well as various experiments that usually end up being recorded on this site.
