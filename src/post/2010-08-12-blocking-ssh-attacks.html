  I run this on almost any server that isn't behind another firewall blocking $SSH_PORT. I got this from somewhere
  else, but it was a long time ago and I don't remember the source anymore.<br />
  <br />
  <pre>
<br />SSH_PORT=22  # I think ssh on !22 is silly, but to each their own<br />TRUSTED_SUBNET_OR_HOST=mybox.homeip.com # or a subnet you trust<br /><br />iptables -A ssh_drop -j DROP -m comment --comment "SSH attack drop"<br />iptables -A INPUT  -p tcp -m tcp -s $TRUSTED_SUBNET_OR_HOST --dport $SSH_PORT  -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport $SSH_PORT -m recent --name sshattack --set<br />iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport $SSH_PORT -m state --state NEW -m recent --name sshattack --rcheck --seconds 60 --hitcount 3 -j LOG --log-prefix 'SSH Attack DROP: '<br />iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport $SSH_PORT -m state --state NEW -m recent --name sshattack --rcheck --seconds 60 --hitcount 3 -j ssh_drop<br />
</pre><br />
  <br />
  Basically, this counts connection attempts on port 22 and starts dropping attempts after the third one (obviously
  adjust --hitcount to taste). It times out after 60 seconds, so I don't accidentally lock myself out. I see a few
  attacks a day start then go away after the drop. I've never seen one come back after the window reopens (unless it
  was myself trying to "attack"). It's also 0 maintenance unlike the userspace solutions. A lot of people like tcp
  wrappers, but that still lets attackers hammer the port. Using both works nicely.<br />
  <br />
  This and DenyHosts don't help with distributed attacks, which is why I'm moving towards key-only logins and maybe
  picking up some YubiKeys. (yubico.com)
