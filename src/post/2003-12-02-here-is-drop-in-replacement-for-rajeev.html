  Here is a drop-in replacement for Rajeev Kumar's bootprofile, written in (bourne|korn|posix) shell. Everything
  required [on my rh9/rawhide laptop] is in /bin or /sbin. It's nice when you like to put everything on separate LVM
  volumes like I do. Here it is: <a href="http://tobert.googlepages.com/bootprofile.sh">bootprofile.sh</a>. View now:
