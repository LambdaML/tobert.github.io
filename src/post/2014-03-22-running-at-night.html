  I've been running regularly for more than 6 months and see no reason why that will ever stop. With a 10k behind me,
  I'm training to do a half marathon. The twist in my regimen is that I usually run at night with my <a href=

  Running at night is a different experience from running under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" target=
  "_blank">day star</a>. There are less people, less traffic, it's cooler, and more dangerous.<br />
  <br />
  Tip 1: stay on the right-hand side of the road.<br />
  <br />
  If you're going against traffic, the headlights will constantly ruin your night vision. Most cars are set up to shine
  the headlights a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/repair/1347221" target="_blank">little to
  the right</a>, which means you're getting far more lights shined in your eyes if you're on the left side of the
  road.<br />
  <br />
  Tip 2: thin-soled shoes are dangerous.<br />
  <br />
  Since I started running, I've become a huge fan of Vibram Five-fingers shoes. My first model was the <a href=
  "http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-TrekSport-Mens.htm" target="_blank">Treksport</a>. I step on
  a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidambar" target="_blank">liquidambar</a> <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Liquidambaseedpod.JPG" target="_blank">seed pods</a> every time I go out. With the
  Treksports I feel them but it does not hurt much. The one time I wore my pair of&nbsp;<a href=
  "http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Mens.htm" target="_blank">KSO</a>'s, I hit a rock at full
  force and have not worn them since. When the strap on my Treksports broke, I bought a pair of <a href=
  "http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-Speed-Mens.htm?activity=casual" target="_blank">Speed</a> and
  have found the protection satisfactory, but not quite as good as the Treksport.<br />
  <br />
  Tip 3: try using a metronome instead of music.<br />
  <br />
  I tried listening to upbeat music when I started out, but it kept distracting me. For me, running is more mental than
  physical, so this is rather important. I installed a metronome app on my phone and started at around 80BPM, taking
  two steps to a beat to reach 160 steps per minute. It's hard at first, but once you get into you it becomes easy to
  line up your steps &amp; breathing and really pack the miles on. It's also handy on race day to keep yourself from
  overdoing it early in the race.<br />
  <br />
  Another advantage over music is that the tick of the metronome doesn't drown out the sounds around you. The
  additional sensory information can be crucial at night.<br />
  <br />
  Tip 4: have a regular route and stick to it.<br />
  <br />
  This is an unusual one for me. Any time I run during the day, I take off in a random direction and try to find new
  routes every time. At night, I pretty much always take the same 5 mile route. I know where all of the sidewalk bulges
  are. I know where people smoke in their driveways. It really helps lighten the mental load and keep me safe.<br />
