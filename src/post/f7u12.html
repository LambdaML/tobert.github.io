<!-- decided to do this one in HTML originally because I thought about laying out
     the comic using the bootstrap grid. May yet do that since it would automatically
     pop vertical on mobile, but for now it's just a png export from OmniGraffle. -->

<p>My talk proposal for OSCON 2014 was not accepted so I was attending as a booth brain.
I liked this plan just fine since I wouldn't have to prepare much
and could simply attend the conference and have fun showing off Cassandra / Spark demos on
<a href="/post/2014-02-07-portacluster.html">portacluster</a>. Then, 2 weeks before the conference,
this happened.</p>

<p>Following that conversation, I looked at the source for many open source 2048 games, including
<a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">the original</a>. Since I needed to add swipe
controls as well as gathering metrics from the game, I decided to spend an evening writing my own clone
using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> to see how far I could get. I was able to push a nearly complete
version of it
<a href="https://github.com/tobert/f7u12/commit/e8bb10d666848b432324f8302dcaaa16e4e9e67a">to github</a>
the next day.
</p>

<p>I actually had working code the previous evening, but I needed a name. One of the versions of the game
I considered had a fun quote in its <a href="https://github.com/Saming/2048/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>,
"The best game you'll ever hate." Somehow, that instantly made me think of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu">
rage comics</a> and the name was set.</p>

<p>
Besides using D3, the f7u12 version of the game is different in other ways. The game itself is isolated in
the <a href="https://github.com/tobert/f7u12/blob/master/public/js/f7u12.js">f7u12.js</a> file. It does not
implement input or any game rules besides scoring. The whole thing is designed to be easy to wire up in
various ways so I could quickly adapt to whatever equipment was available in our booth, which was not clear
to me until 5 minutes before the doors opened - more about that later.
</p>

<p>Here is the game. It is not reporting to any servers. Moves can be made with the arrow keys, by clicking
on the d-pad to the right, or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I decided to write the game from scratch was that I wanted to make it possible
to capture everything that is happening, including some things beyond the obvious such as the
amount of time between moves, direction choices, and the entire board state.</p>

<p>While many implementations use a 2-dimensional array, e.g. <code>[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]</code>, which
could be translated to something easier to serialize, but it's even easier with the way that f7u12 implements it
as a flat array, e.g. <code>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]</code>.

<p>If you make a few moves in the game above, the data that gets sent to Cassandra should show up in the
log area below.</p>
