  I wrote a couple SNMP plugins for Nagios to check disk space and running processes. They are now in the contrib
  directory in the <a href="http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/">Nagios Plugins</a> package.<br />
  They both should work on Windows 2000 (and up) and Novell. HP-UX, unfortunately, does not ship with the Host-Resource
  MIB by default, so I'm using the Net-SNMP daemon at work. It's a little flakey, but gets the job done. <a href=
  "http://www.snmpresearch.com/">SNMP Research</a> provides an extended SNMP daemon for HP-UX and other operating
  systems that includes the host resource MIB.<br />
  <br />
  I'm also author and maintainer of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Etobeya/Nagios-Object/">Nagios::Object</a>
  and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Etobeya/Nagios-Cmd/">Nagios::Cmd</a> modules on <a href=
  "http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.
