I've been blogging a bit more often lately and as a result, I've been getting
annoyed with the limitations of Blogger. It was a fine service for the years
when I didn't write much. Now that I'm doing a lot more technical blogging,
I need a more customizable platform to generate my content.

To be honest, I didn't spend a lot of time researching. Before I switched to Blogger, I generated
static pages with a perl script. It's 2014 so I took a look at Jekyll, but didn't find it to my
liking for aesthetic reasons. After some light searching, I came across Hugo which does pretty much
exactly what I want. It's Go + markdown with some extensions that seem to be similar to Jekyll's. It
took me a couple hours to get used to how it works, but now that I have the hang of it I'm pretty
happy.

As you probably noticed, I chose to go with Bootstrap 3 for the HTML. As an ops guy who has
committed multiple atrocities against sensible web design, I think Bootstrap's contribution is
immesurable. I plug it in and use maybe 5% of the functionality and I get a site that is responsive
-- try it! resize your browser down to cell phone size -- and looks decent enough for the low cost
of FREE. So, yeah, I like Bootstrap because I'm lazy and totally uninterested in the madness of CSS.
