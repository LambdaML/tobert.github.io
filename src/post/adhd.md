Ohai! (10)
=========

Writing these posts is the most difficult part of my job and IMO that's weird.
I'm good at technology. I'm good at English. I have a lot to say and *want* to say
it. So what's the problem?

A friend of mine who has a child with ADHD asked me for some tips a while back. I've
been thinking about what to write for a while and haven't really settled on anything
so here we go...

Living with ADHD (11)
=====================

As a father, I've spent a lot more time than I otherwise would trying to remember what
it was like being my son's age. He's 4. Fortunately I can remember quite a bit going
back to around this time in his life. It's a huge help when, as
[@Jasont1022](https://twitter.com/Jasont1022) puts it, he's "being 4". This introspection
often turns up memories of my awful academic life, which makes a lot more sense now.

I remember hearing about ADD on TV as a kid, but
I don't remember ever hearing my parents or teachers mention it. Even in high school in
the late 1990's, nobody really brought it up. Looking back, almost all of the big problems
I had academically fit the profile.

Even though I was convinced of my diagnosis for years, I finally went in to get tested
for ADHD in 2010. My doctor sent me to a specialist
in San Jose. The test is administered what appeared to be an ~i486 era PC running
a simple-looking DOS application.
Of course, the test broke. The doctor, who I suspect will retire any day now, looked at the
results and said something like, "oh yeah. You are definitely ADHD." The test broke because
my response times when wired up to the computer were much lower than the software designers
thought was possible. Clearly this software predates DOOM.

We discussed treatment options and explored a few digressions before he had to (politely) kick
me out. I declined the idea of using neuro-feedback treatment and agreed to talk to my doctor
about medication if I decided to explore that avenue (more on that later).

The Problem (3)
===============

I remember going to parent-teacher conferences many times during my K-12 education. I didn't
usually pay much attention, but there's this one phrase that came up almost every time:
"Al never turns in homework, but he always aces the tests and quizzes. If he'd just apply
himself ...." I know my teachers were frustrated. What I don't think they ever understood
is how frustrated I was too. I wanted to do it. I just couldn't find the energy, no matter
how hard I tried.

Different people will have different experiences, but one that I think is common is the hump.
There might be a clinical term for it, but who cares. It's the hump. It's related to impulse
control, which is certainly something I struggle with, but the hump is something like an
inversion of impulse control. Umm. Let me tell you about homework.

Homework (5)
============

Earlier this year my employer [sent me to Japan](/post/Japan-2014-02-07-2014.html) to speak at a
[Cassandra](http://planetcassandra.com) conference. I'd been toying with the idea of learning
Japanese ever since my first exposure to subtitled anime and decided that time was imminent, so
I found a teacher and started taking lessons.

I really love learning Japanese. Ask anybody who has to put up with my practicing on them.
It is rated one of the most difficult languages for English
speakers to learn; this is attractive and daunting simulateously! The real problem for someone
with ADHD is how Japanese is usually taught: by rote. While many consider rote work to be
trivial, when you have ADHD it's the opposite.

I think about doing the homework every day. Every damn day. And I don't. Some days I make it
as far as standing up to go get my books, then I find some distraction.

As I write this, I have an assignment I need to do for tomorrow and suddenly it's attractive because it would mean switching from writing this.

This is a normal every-day feeling for me.

When I go to do the homework, for whatever reasons the impulse to do *anything* else is
irresistable. By anything, I mean anything. I'll clean toilets, doodle, get thrown out of class .... anything.

People will tell me "just do it man!" For whatever stupid reasons, it always has the opposite
effect. I'll sit down all ready to power through it and there's this ... wall. Hill. Hump.

My guess is that this is what drug addicts feel like when presented with drugs,
but fortunately that's not a problem I have so I'm not sure.

An Experiment
=============

Let's say that neurotypical (NT) is like walking along on a flat plane. If I've interpreted
what my academically successful NT friends tell me, homework is like being asked to take
a tedious detour, but it's no big deal, you just do it.

When I'm presented with the same task -- even though
I know exactly what to do, how long it will take, how to optimize, what the finished product
will look like -- my mind is stuck as if I'd been asked
to dispose of trinkets in some far-away volcano.  I'll hapilly build you a forge, grind
the trinket into dust with my teeth, or any number of "creatively lazy" ideas, but I cannot
take a step forward. It's a little like anxiety, but without that whole-body awfulness. It's
just in my head. And it's just as hard to manage as a full-blown anxiety attack. Actually,
I know how to handle myself in an anxiety attack, but I still don't know how to make myself
do homework. Even when it's for something or someone I love.

One of the paradoxes of ADHD is that sometimes you get the exact inverse of the hump. Some
thing, in my case usually something my peers find banal, will grab my attention and I won't
be able to put it down until I've conquered it. Programming does this to me sometimes. In
this case, it can be [pretty cool](http://tobert.org/disk-latency-graphs/), or sometimes
[boring](https://github.com/tobert/lnxnsl).

**Pro tip**: Find an opportunity for mastery in every task. The desire for mastery is,
in my case, untouched by ADHD.

For example, when I do the dishes (bar none, my least
favorite chore), I get every pan sparkly, every plate *completely* clean. It takes me even
longer to do the task this way, but without the added challenge of doing it well, I wouldn't
be able to do it at all. Just ask my mother. Oh boy. Anwyays, you'd be surprised at how
many ways there are to wash dishes.

Drugs
=====

I've been consuming what should be lethal amounts of caffeine since forever, but especially
from the time I started drinking coffee around the age of 13. Adding milk and sugar was too
tedious so I started drinking it black. There are other reasons, but mostly it's the tedium
of preparing the cup 3-10x a day that drove me to black coffee. I can't tell you how happy
I am that it's so easy to get fresh beans these days.

There's a story in there somewhere but this section is supposed to be about drugs.

I've had an Adderall prescription for a couple years now. It works. The problem is it makes
me really irritable. OK OK. I make the Hulk look like a Zen Master. Anyways, it does make it
easier to get past the hump, but only a little bit so I don't take it often. I will probably
ask to try something else next time I see my doctor.

**Pro tip**: Adderall does not need to build up can be taken as-needed. Use it to practice
getting tedious jobs done then practice without it. Repeat forever.

I've found stimulants to be quite useful in getting things done, but also noticed the toll
they take. I take the pills on days I think I'll really need them. It seems to be a stress
tradeoff - save a little avoidance stress now, pay the price later. Take it for a few days,
pay for a couple weeks.

Kthxbai!

If you noticed the numbers to the right of the headings above, that's a rough count of
how many times I bounced away from my editor to tweet,
[queue some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhrELiDVUA),
watch a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk), or check Hipchat. My
gut tells me that the numbers would be similar if I put them in comments in my code.

The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/index.shtml) has a nice overview of the clinical side of ADHD.
