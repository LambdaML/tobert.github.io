  Captain! The thermocouple is failing, the engines are down and we can’t start them until it’s fixed!<br />
  <br />
  Sounds cool, right? This humble safety device isn’t that far-fetched. If you have a gas-powered hot water heater, you
  have one of your very own. It solves a dangerous problem with pilot lights. A pilot light is a small flame that is
  kept burning indefinitely inside your gas furnace or hot water heater. It gets a tiny trickle of gas from the main
  supply using barely enough volume to show up on your bill.<br />
  <br />

  <div>
    The engineers in the audience will ask, what happens when the pilot light goes out? Without a thermocouple, it will
    seep tiny bits of gas into the combustion chamber of the device. In a few hours, it can leak enough gas for a small
    explosion, probably just enough to shorten your eyebrows. If you were on vacation in Tahiti for a month and there
    is no circulation, enough gas could build up to some serious damage to homes and humans.

    The engineering requirements are interesting:<br />
    <br />

    <ul>
      <li>no external electricity is available</li>

      <li>has to be reliable</li>

      <li>has to work in a multitude of physical environments, from indoor closets to filthy barns</li>

      <li>must behave consistently across a large temperature range</li>

      <li>cannot require regular maintenance</li>

      <li>HUMAN SAFETY IS AT RISK&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>When you need something reliable, you need something simple. Enter the thermocouple.<br />
    <br />
    The science of how a thermocouple works is described on <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple">Wikipedia</a>. I wanted to send that to people, but it requires a lot
    of background in physics to even parse what the article says. While the physics in play are fascinating, at the end
    of the day it’s a simple device. The trick is in the first sentence on Wikipedia,<br />
    <br />
    “In 1821, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">German</a>–<a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia">Estonian</a> physicist <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johann_Seebeck">Thomas Johann Seebeck</a> discovered that when any conductor
    is subjected to a thermal gradient, it will generate a voltage.”<br />
    <br />
    What does this have to do with hot water heaters? We need a way to detect when the pilot light has gone out. No
    electronics, or even electricity is available. Natural gas burns at 900-1,500° Celsius. You don’t even have to
    convert that to Fahrenheit to see that we have a considerable temperature delta at our disposal, so there’s an
    opportunity to use the Seebeck effect to create a safe and reliable device.<br />
    <br />
    In layman terms, the thermocouple found in household hot water heaters is a probe that is placed inside a flame
    with two wires made of different metal. This creates a temperature gradient, since the metals disperse heat at
    different rates. This generates a few microwatts of current, which is boosted by a transformer connected to a
    solenoid. When current is present, the solenoid holds the gas valve open. When there is not enough current, the
    valve is pushed closed by a spring, so most failures will lead to the gas being turned off, including the
    thermocouple itself failing. The device itself is intended to act like a fuse or breaker, giving up before any
    other component resulting in a known-safe condition.<br />
