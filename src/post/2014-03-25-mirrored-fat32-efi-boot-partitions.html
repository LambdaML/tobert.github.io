  Most modern hardware ships with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target=
  "_blank">UEFI</a> firmware and can be booted in EFI mode automatically when a disk is found with EFI setup. When I
  recently put <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> on my desktop machine, I went with
  <a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot/" target="_blank">gummiboot</a> to try something new and I
  really like the results.<br />
  <br />
  Now that I'm bringing my Xeon machine back online for some benchmarking, I want to use gummiboot there too. The twist
  is that while my desktop has a single SSD for root+data, this machine has a few more drives installed.<br />
  <br />

  The root drives actually aren't visible in the photo. They're 2.5" SATA drives behind the side panel on the left
  side, directly behind the red and black SAS tray.<br />
  <br />
  Since I'm installing a mirrored root on btrfs and using EFI, I want to have /boot mirrored to both drives so the
  system will still boot if one of them fails. The easy way would be to format both and rsync with a cron job. While
  that would catch 99% of updates, I figure since I'm using this machine for crazy disk stuff I might as well try
  mirroring the EFI filesystem.<br />
  <br />
  Because of the way EFI works, FAT32 is pretty much the only decent choice for a filesystem on the EFI partition (code
  ef02). Since /boot only needs to hold initramfs, kernels, and the EFI configuration, I'll simply mount it on /boot as
  vfat.<br />
  <br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tobert/9754425.js" type="text/javascript">
</script> This is how it's set up on my desktop. But now I want mirroring. I tried mdraid, but even with metadata 1.0
the fat filesystem can't be direct mounted. No big deal. The Linux LVM is actually a frontend to a kernel disk
abstraction called device mapper. It includes a mirror target, so all I had to do was spin up a quick mirrored LV then
dump the device mapper table.<br />
  <br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tobert/9754543.js" type="text/javascript">
</script> Here's the breakdown of what the device mapper table says in English:<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">0 8192 mirror core 1 1024 2 253:0 0
  253:1 0 1 handle_errors</span><br />
  <br />
  Present blocks 0 to 8192 as a mirror with in-core replication log of the size 1024 with 2 devices, 253:0 and 253:1
  both starting at offset 0 with one argument of 'handle_errors'. &nbsp;The syntax is terse and the documentation is
  incomplete, so that's as far as I can tell. Device mapper can do a lot more than this, but this is all I need for
  now.<br />
  <br />
  With the knowledge of what an LVM-created device mapper table looks like, writing a script that sets up the mirror is
  pretty easy. I'll throw this into a systemd unit file when I'm done with the setup.<br />
  <br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tobert/9755039.js" type="text/javascript">
</script> With that script written the rest is mostly by the book (<a href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gummiboot" target="_blank">wiki</a>), but I'll go ahead and test that the
partitions are usable alone.<br />
  <br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tobert/9755107.js" type="text/javascript">
</script> And with that, my workstation has redundant boot drives and can be set up to boot with gummitboot per the
wiki instructions.<br />
  <br />
  Edit: I may have spoke too soon. Will update again when I figure out why gummiboot won't run.
