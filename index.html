  </header>
2014-04-09 - I&rsquo;ve been blogging a bit more often lately and as a result, I&rsquo;ve been getting annoyed with the limitations of Blogger. It was a fine service for the years when I didn&rsquo;t write much. Now that I&rsquo;m doing a lot more technical blogging, I need a more customizable platform to generate my content.

  </header>
2014-03-29 - One of the topics that comes up over and over at Datastax is how to choose the right disk systems to go with Cassandra. While Datastax provides guidance on this issue, a lot of customers still want to know why: why not use 3T SATA drives? Why are SSDs so great? What is the difference between 15k NL-SAS and a consumer-grade SSD? To answer these questions, I'm running a bunch of benchmarks on the disks with a focus on latency.One of the most important restrictions I've placed on the project is that all of the tests in the first series are going to be run on the same machine.

  </header>
2014-03-25 - Most modern hardware ships with UEFI firmware and can be booted in EFI mode automatically when a disk is found with EFI setup. When I recently put Arch Linux on my desktop machine, I went with gummiboot to try something new and I really like the results.Now that I'm bringing my Xeon machine back online for some benchmarking, I want to use gummiboot there too. The twist is that while my desktop has a single SSD for root+data, this machine has a few more drives installed.The root drives actually aren't visible in the photo.

  </header>
2014-03-22 - I've been running regularly for more than 6 months and see no reason why that will ever stop. With a 10k behind me, I'm training to do a half marathon. The twist in my regimen is that I usually run at night with my samoyed.Running at night is a different experience from running under the day star. There are less people, less traffic, it's cooler, and more dangerous.Tip 1: stay on the right-hand side of the road.If you're going against traffic, the headlights will constantly ruin your night vision.

  </header>
2014-03-19 - I regularly see posts on Twitter about some new whiz-bang shell or vim plugin that automates some task, making it more pleasant. I almost never use any of them.The reasons why can be traced back to my first job as a systems administrator, where I had to learn Solaris on the fly. I learned most of my Unix-fu on Linux, where I learned on bash. The shop I was working at used the Bourne shell that shipped with Solaris 2.6 and 2.7.

2014-03-10 - I'm always looking for new ways to educate my audience and have recently started setting up my workstation for recording video to post on Youtube. While I could have gone down the easy road and used my Mac laptop for all of this, I wanted to see what it would take to make it all work on my Linux workstation.There are lots of application choices for capturing and recording video on Linux.

2014-02-19 - Earlier this evening, my teenage niece posted an article titled "Letting My Wife Go" on Facebook. I gave it a quick read, liked it, then shared it. The link is at the end of this note.Two people whom I admire quickly called me out for posting something with so little substance. I took another look at it and realized that I agree. It doesn't have a lot to offer. I was reading a lot more into it than was actually there.

    <h2><a href='https://tobert.github.io/post/2014-02-07-portacluster'>Portacluster</a> </h2>
  </header>
2014-02-07 - The parts are in the mail!I've been excited about this idea for a few years now, but haven't had a good reason and/or resources to go for it. Now that my work involves traveling around and showing off Cassandra, I need a suitable demo cluster. One good rule of presenting to audiences is to never rely on the internet connection if you can help it. Murphy's Law dictates that if you rely on the wifi for an important part of your talk, said wifi will almost certainly fail when you need it most.My original concept for the porta-cluster was to string a series of workstation motherboards together in a shipping case in such a way that they have just enough airflow and cabling to look decent but not hide anything.But that's still a bit unwieldy with lots of problems such as heatsink/fan size/flow, where to put the PSUs, etc..

  </header>
2014-02-07 - One of the best and worst things about being an open source evangelist is traveling often. I am not (yet) a seasoned traveler. Every trip teaches me something new and my trip to Japan was a real eye-opener.The primary objective of this trip was to speak at Cassandra 日本 2014. IMO it was a success. I already posted my Cassandra 日本 2014 Recap on PlanetCassandra. I also planned to vacation attend some meetups, so I stayed there for a week.I ended up staying in Akihabara.
