<p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging a bit more often lately and as a result, I&rsquo;ve been getting
annoyed with the limitations of Blogger. It was a fine service for the years
when I didn&rsquo;t write much. Now that I&rsquo;m doing a lot more technical blogging,
I need a more customizable platform to generate my content.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time researching. Before I switched to Blogger, I generated
static pages with a perl script. It&rsquo;s 2014 so I took a look at Jekyll, but didn&rsquo;t find it to my
liking for aesthetic reasons. After some light searching, I came across Hugo which does pretty much
exactly what I want. It&rsquo;s Go + markdown with some extensions that seem to be similar to Jekyll&rsquo;s. It
took me a couple hours to get used to how it works, but now that I have the hang of it I&rsquo;m pretty
happy.</p>

<p>As you probably noticed, I chose to go with Bootstrap 3 for the HTML. As an ops guy who has
committed multiple atrocities against sensible web design, I think Bootstrap&rsquo;s contribution is
immesurable. I plug it in and use maybe 5% of the functionality and I get a site that is responsive
&ndash; try it! resize your browser down to cell phone size &ndash; and looks decent enough for the low cost
of FREE. So, yeah, I like Bootstrap because I&rsquo;m lazy and totally uninterested in the madness of CSS.</p>
