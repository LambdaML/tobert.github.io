<span class="boldunder"></span>I hacked <a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/root-tail.html">root-tail</a> to work with Nautilus, KDE, and hopefully XFCE4's xfdesktop.  I took the toon_root.c file from <a href="http://xpenguins.seul.org/">xpenguins</a> and :r'd it into root-tail.c.  A few modifications later and I had a working root-tail for nautilus.  <br /><br />Download the tarball: <a href="http://tobert.googlepages.com/root-tail-xpenguins.tar.gz">root-tail-xpenguins.tar.gz</a> or just <a href="http://tobert.googlepages.com/root-tail.c">root-tail.c</a>. Here it is in HTML: <a href="http://tobert.googlepages.com/root-tail.c.html">root-tail.c.html</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://tobert.googlepages.com/screenshot-gnome-root-tail.jpg">Screenshot (40k)</a>
